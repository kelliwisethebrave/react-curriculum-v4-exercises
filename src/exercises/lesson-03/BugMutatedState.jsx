/*
  BUG #2 — State Issue

  This component displays a count and updates it when the button is clicked.
  However, the way the count is being changed causes the component to behave
  incorrectly.
*/

import { useState } from 'react';
export default function BugMutatedState() {
  let [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleAdd() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Bug 2 Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleAdd}>Add 1</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Explanation:
// Using count++ modifies the variable directly.
// In React, we want to avoid modifying variables
// directly. We also want to include the method we
// use to calculate our new value
// in the same step as using setCount, which will
// update state and trigger a re-render.
